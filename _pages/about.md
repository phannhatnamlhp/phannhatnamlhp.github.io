Jim embarked on a lifelong commitment to community service at a young age. In 2014, he participated in the `Help Portrait` photography event organized by `Canon Vietnam`, where Nam and the team took photos of older people in Cu Chi Province to give those people happiness and belief in life. The following year, he joined a `charity trip` with Tran Dang Tuan, Former Deputy General Director of Vietnam Television, to Tuan Giao district in Dien Bien Province. This experience opened Jim's eyes to the stark contrast between his privileged upbringing and the struggles faced by low-income families.

With that in mind, he and his mother created `Little Stars Science Club` in 2015 with science classes and field trips to help Ho Chi Minh City students develop their soft skills and enrich their knowledge in general sciences through projects and experiments. They also organized short trips to `plant trees on bare hills` and `donate necessities to poverty`. Profit from those activities are later distributed back to promote STEM activities in Vietnam rural areas. His dedication later led him to find `Chicken Minds`. This project aims to educate Vietnamese students through online classes and offline workshops, which later merged with The Gifted Battlefield Organization. When he enrolled at the University of South Florida, hoping to bring great value to local companies in Tampa, Florida, he joined `HEXA Consulting` as a `Project Manager` and managed 7 consultants to advise on growth strategy for 2 companies.

He has great responsibilities in those organizations with heavy workloads, but he always pays attention to improving himself academically and professionally. In his first year at the University of South Florida, he achieved a `4.0 GPA` while `double majoring` in `Finance` and `Quantitative Economics & Econometrics` while being the advisor of The Gifted Battlefield, Seasonal IT Specialist at Sao Mai Long Son Kindergarten, and Project Manager at HEXA Consulting Club at USF. As of May 24th 2024, Jim accepted his position as a Workday Systems Analyst Co-Op at `Bain & Company`, starting in July 2024. He was also promoted to `Vice-President` of the HEXA Consulting Club.

Looking towards the future, Jim aspires to work in the `financial or consulting` sector, aiming to make a significant impact on stakeholders. This ambition aligns with his lifelong commitment to building a better community, a journey he began at a young age.
