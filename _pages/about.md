Jim (Nam) Phan started his `community service journey` very young. In 2014, he participated in the `'Help Portrait'` photography program. Nam and the team took photos of older people in Cu Chi Province to give those people happiness and belief in life. In 2015, he participated in a `charity trip` with Tran Dang Tuan - Former Deputy General Director of Vietnam Television in Tuan Giao district, Dien Bien Province. After that trip, Nam realized that `he was a lucky boy`. He had good conditions to grow and study, while low-income families didn't even have smartphones.

With that in mind, he and his mother created the `'Little Stars Science Club'` in 2015 with science classes and field trips to help Ho Chi Minh City students develop their soft skills and enrich their knowledge in general sciences through projects and experiments. They also organize short trips to `plant trees on bare hills` and `donate necessities to poverty`. After six years, his dedication to education has led him to create `Chicken Minds`. This project aims to educate Vietnamese students through online classes and offline workshops, which later merged with `The Gifted Battlefield Organization`. When he enrolled at the `University of South Florida`, hoping to bring great value to local companies in Tampa, Florida, he acted as the `Project Manager` for `HEXA Consulting` to manage 7 consultants and build a growth strategy for 2 companies.

He has `great responsibilities` in those organizations with heavy workloads, but he always pays attention to improving himself academically and professionally. In his first year at the University of South Florida, he achieved a `4.0 GPA` while `double majoring` in `Finance` and `Quantitative Economics & Econometrics` while being the advisor of The Gifted Battlefield, Seasonal IT Specialist at Sao Mai Long Son Kindergarten, and Project Manager at HEXA Consulting Club at USF. As per the last update of this page (05/24/2024), he accepted his position as a Workday Systems Analyst Co-Op at `Bain & Company` and will start working at Bain in July 2024. He was also promoted to `Vice-President` of the HEXA Consulting Club.

In the future, he aims to work in the `financial or consulting` field to impact the stakeholders significantly, following his commitment to building a better community at his young age.
