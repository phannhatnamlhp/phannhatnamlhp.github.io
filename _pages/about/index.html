<p>Jim (Nam) Phan started his <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">community service journey</code> very young. In 2014, he participated in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Help Portrait'</code> photography program. Nam and the team took photos of older people in Cu Chi Province to give those people happiness and belief in life. In 2015, he participated in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">charity trip</code> with Tran Dang Tuan - Former Deputy General Director of Vietnam Television in Tuan Giao district, Dien Bien Province. After that trip, Nam realized that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">he was a lucky boy</code>. He had good conditions to grow and study, while low-income families didnâ€™t even have smartphones.</p>

<p>With that in mind, he and his mother created the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Little Stars Science Club'</code> in 2015 with science classes and field trips to help Ho Chi Minh City students develop their soft skills and enrich their knowledge in general sciences through projects and experiments. They also organize short trips to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plant trees on bare hills</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">donate necessities to poverty</code>. After six years, his dedication to education has led him to create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chicken Minds</code>. This project aims to educate Vietnamese students through online classes and offline workshops, which later merged with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Gifted Battlefield Organization</code>. When he enrolled at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">University of South Florida</code>, hoping to bring great value to local companies in Tampa, Florida, he acted as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Project Manager</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HEXA Consulting</code> to manage 7 consultants and build a growth strategy for 2 companies.</p>

<p>He has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">great responsibilities</code> in those organizations with heavy workloads, but he always pays attention to improving himself academically and professionally. In his first year at the University of South Florida, he achieved a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.0 GPA</code> while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double majoring</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Finance</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Quantitative Economics &amp; Econometrics</code> while being the advisor of The Gifted Battlefield, Seasonal IT Specialist at Sao Mai Long Son Kindergarten, and Project Manager at HEXA Consulting Club at USF. As per the last update of this page (05/24/2024), he accepted his position as a Workday Systems Analyst Co-Op at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bain &amp; Company</code> and will start working at Bain in July 2024. He was also promoted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vice-President</code> of the HEXA Consulting Club.</p>

<p>In the future, he aims to work in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">financial or consulting</code> field to impact the stakeholders significantly, following his commitment to building a better community at his young age.</p>
